# Discord BOT
This is one of my biggest projects so far, as you already know it's a bot for Discord platform with a lot of features and commands that allow you to fully control and customize discord server. I've uploaded only essential files because most of them are only available for my own use. This project is finished but still being updated.

## API
* [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)
* YouTube
* Twitch
* Giphy
* NASA
* FiveM
* Lavaplayer
* [IP Intelligence](http://getipintel.net/)
## AI
One of the cool things is that the bot has access to AI character so it can chat with everyone. I'm currently using ready conversational model since I had some trouble with implementing my own. To chat with AI all you need to do is place `&` symbol before your message, like: `& hi`
